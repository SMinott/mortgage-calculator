# mortgage-calculator


Create a mortgage calculator to calculate the monthly mortgage payment.
    Input the Principal (p), Annual Interest Rate (r), & Period (n).
    
    M = Mortgage must be expressed as a dollar amount with sign & decimal (Math method(s))
    Equation: M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n -1]
    
    p = total amount owed.
    
    n = number of payments. This takes the period of the loan (Ex. 30 year loan) and multiply it by 12 to get the total number of months to pay off loan
    Equation: n * 12
    
    r = Annual Interest Rate. Rate provided is divided by # of months in a year and then by 100 to get the percentage value.
    Equation: r / 12 / 100.
    
    Note: Changes will be made incrementally by refacturing the code.
